- **Loop Time**: Determines the animation is shown in loop.

<br>

With double click on the Animation icon the Animation panel will be shown. Here it is possible watch the animation by sprite and Add event in some animation moment. For example at the last of a bullet animation call a function for destroy the object.
- **Function**: Function name
- **Object**: Script where the function is implemented

## <u>Animator Controller</u>
This element manage the differents states (with Aimation associated) for a object. It is possible create a Animator Controller clicking right button then Create > Animator Controller, althouhg other way is drag and drop a Animation element into object.<br>
Like with Animation is advisable to organize all Animator Controller into same folder. This folder normally is used to store the Animation too.<br>
With double click on Animator Controller icon the Animator panels appears, showing the Animator states and transitions.
